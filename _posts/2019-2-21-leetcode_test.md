4. #### Median of Two Sorted Arrays

   There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

   Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

   You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

```python
    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]

    The median is 2.0
```
