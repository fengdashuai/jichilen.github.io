### 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Medium

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

 

**Example:**

```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```

问题是两两相逆之后怎么连起来

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        p1=head
        if p1==None or p1.next==None:return p1 
        head=p1.next
        nn=ListNode(0)
        while p1!=None and p1.next!=None:
            nn.next=p1.next
            tmp=p1.next.next
            p1.next.next=p1
            p1.next=tmp
            nn=nn.next.next
            p1=nn.next
        return head
```



### 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Hard

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

对于链表来说，要想提高算法效率，就需要多指针配合

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        nn=ListNode(0)
        nn.next=head
        p1=p2=head
        def reverse(p1,p2,nn,n):
            # print(p1.val,p2.val,nn.val)
            if n<=1:
                return
            nn.next=p2
            p2.next=p1
            for i in range(n-2):
                p1=p1.next
            # nn=p2
            # p1,p2=p2.next,p1
            reverse(p2.next,p1,p2,n-1)
        head=nn
        while p2:
            for i in range(k-1):
                if p2.next:
                    p2=p2.next
                else:
                    return head.next
            tmp=p2.next
            reverse(p1,p2,nn,k)
            p1.next=tmp
            nn=p1
            p1=p2=tmp
        return head.next
```

这里是利用递归来进行翻转，其实也可以不用递归，每次用一个指针存放第一个指针，用第二个指针指向这个指针

\26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Easy

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```



```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums)==0:return 0
        i=1;j=1
        while i<len(nums):
            if nums[i]!=nums[i-1]:
                nums[j]=nums[i]
                j+=1
            i+=1
        nums=nums[:j]
        # print(nums)
        return j

```
